Unlike when csfr.html used the hidden form to pass inputs to csfr.php and it showed "Successful login"
the changes created using sessions does not display the "Successful login" nor "Failed login" messages in the div
because the value in the hidden confirmation input is not the same as the confirmation session variable.
