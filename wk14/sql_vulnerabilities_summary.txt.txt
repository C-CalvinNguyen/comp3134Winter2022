Inserting Ben into the getusers_1.php form returns me the SQL Query results in nothing
since active was set to 0

Inserting Ben’-- results in nothing returned.

Inserting Ben’ or 1=1 results in nothing returned

my variable was $sqli = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1 AND firstname = "'. $_POST['firstname'] .'"';

	$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sqli);
        if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
                while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
                echo "ID" . $row['id']. ' FIRSTNAME: '. $row['firstname']. 'ACT>
                }
        }
